# nvim for Arch Linux

Omarchy is the basis for this setup. It works off `LazyVim`. I have just expanded and tweaked it to my own needs.

## Language Support

The core languages I work with the most and need syntax highlighting, LLM, and LSP support for in nvim.

- Python
- GoLang
- Scala
- Markdown
- Javascript/Typescript
- C/C++
- bash/zsh/sh

## LLM/AI

I mostly depend on `amp` for my LLM support in my editor. <https://ampcode.com/>

### 💤 LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
